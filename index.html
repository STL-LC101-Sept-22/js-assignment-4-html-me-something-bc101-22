            <p>The sweet-faced, lovable Labrador Retriever is America's most popular dog breed. Labs are friendly,
               outgoing, and high-spirited companions who have more than enough affection to go around for a family
               looking for a medium-to-large dog. The sturdy, well-balanced Labrador Retriever can, depending on the
               sex, stand from 21.5 to 24.5 inches at the shoulder and weigh between 55 to 80 pounds. The dense, hard
               coat comes in yellow, black, and a luscious chocolate. The head is wide, the eyes glimmer with
               kindliness, and the thick, tapering 'otter tail' seems to be forever signaling the breed's innate
               eagerness. Labs are famously friendly. They are companionable housemates who bond with the whole family,
               and they socialize well with neighbor dogs and humans alike. But don't mistake his easygoing personality
               for low energy: The Lab is an enthusiastic athlete that requires lots of exercise, like swimming and
               marathon games of fetch, to keep physically and mentally fit.</p>

            <p>The one-of-a-kind French Bulldog, with his large bat ears and even disposition, is one of the world's
               most popular small-dog breeds, especially among city dwellers. The Frenchie is playful, alert, adaptable,
               and completely irresistible. The French Bulldog resembles a Bulldog in miniature, except for the large,
               erect 'bat ears' that are the breed's trademark feature. The head is large and square, with heavy
               wrinkles rolled above the extremely short nose. The body beneath the smooth, brilliant coat is compact
               and muscular. The bright, affectionate Frenchie is a charmer. Dogs of few words, Frenchies don't bark
               much but their alertness makes them excellent watchdogs. They happily adapt to life with singles,
               couples, or families, and do not require a lot of outdoor exercise. They get on well with other animals
               and enjoy making new friends of the human variety. It is no wonder that city folk from Paris to Peoria
               swear by this vastly amusing and companionable breed.</p>

            <p>The Golden Retriever, an exuberant Scottish gundog of great beauty, stands among America's most popular
               dog breeds. They are serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the blind, and in
               search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when
               not at work. The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense,
               lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent
               eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. In motion, Goldens move with a smooth,
               powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers say, with a 'merry action.' The most
               complete records of the development of the Golden Retriever are included in the record books that were
               kept from 1835 until about 1890 by the gamekeepers at the Guisachan (pronounced Gooeesicun) estate of
               Lord Tweedmouth at Inverness-Shire, Scotland. These records were released to public notice in Country
               Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth's great-nephew, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, historian and sportsman,
               published material that had been left by his ancestor. They provided factual confirmation to the stories
               that had been handed down through generations. Goldens are outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please
               family dogs, and relatively easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life and maintain
               this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For a breed
               built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and fetching are natural pastimes.</p>

            <p>Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile,
               muscular dog of noble character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the
               German Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight. German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at
               the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than
               angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch or two and reach great
               speeds. There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but
               experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn
               commands for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones.
               German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, but, the breed standard says,
               there's a 'certain aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships.</p>

                  <li>40-50 pounds (female standard)</li>

               </ul>
            </ul>

            <p>Whether Standard, Miniature, or Toy, and either black, white, or apricot, the Poodle stands proudly among
               dogdom's true aristocrats. Beneath the curly, low-allergen coat is an elegant athlete and companion for
               all reasons and seasons.

               Poodles come in three size varieties: Standards should be more than 15 inches tall at the shoulder;
               Miniatures are 15 inches or under; Toys stand no more than 10 inches. All three varieties have the same
               build and proportions. At dog shows, Poodles are usually seen in the elaborate Continental clip. Most pet
               owners prefer the simpler Sporting clip, in which the coat is shorn to follow the outline of the squarely
               built, smoothly muscled body. Forget any preconceived notions about Poodles you may have: Poodles are
               eager, athletic, and wickedly smart dogs of remarkable versatility. The Standard, with his greater size
               and strength, is the best all-around athlete of the family, but all Poodles can be trained with great
               success.</p>
